This is a project for creating a alarm sound detecting wearable for a deaf person. 
This model is first created in matlab to test its efficiency. The model is based on extracting Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficient(LPCC) from sound and classifying the sounds on the basis of Hidden Markov Model(HMM).
